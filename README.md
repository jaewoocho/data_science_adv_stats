## Course Description
Predicting future outcomes is fundamental to human activity. Understanding how past events lead to current conditions can enables us to make 
predictions about the future. This course will focus on how we can predictions about the future based on past evidence. Applied uses include 
forecasting market outcomes (e.g., stocks, company earnings) to human behavior (e.g., emotions, public health policy).

The majority of the course covers time series forecasting to use past performance patterns to make predictions about the future. Key topics in 
this component includes regression, decomposition, smoothing, ARIMA models, and dynamic covariation. A second component will focus on applying 
dimension reduction techniques such as exploratory graph analysis (EGA) to survey data. A third component of this course will focus on A/B 
testing (also referred to as experimental design). In this component, we’ll cover how we can manipulate different features of the stimulus/environment 
to uncover predictions about behavior.

This course will use R statistical software and packages. All examples in the course will be provided through R code and all modeling can be performed 
using open-source R packages. Accompanying books are free and based in R. We will not cover all of the material in any one book, but they are valuable 
resources for you to hone your skills and continue your career path. Although this course primarily uses R, you are welcome to code in your language of
choice. So long as you can complete the analyses successfully and demonstrate mastery of the concepts, then the course objectives are fulfilled. You are 
also encouraged to use generative AI – my perspective is that what is learned in this course is only the start of your learning and generative AI is a tool 
that can take your learning to the next level.
